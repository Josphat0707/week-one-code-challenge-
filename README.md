#WEEK ONE CODE CHALLENGE
##DESCRIPTION
There are three tests meant to be done for this week's code challenge.The first test entails writing a program that takes in a student's marks as an input and in return it produces a grade based on the grading system which is set as the condition.(index.js)

The second test entailswriting a program that requires a person to key in their driving speed. The program checks whether the speed keyed in is per the speed limit. If the speed is per the speed limit, the program will return "okay". If the speed keyed in is greater than the speed limit, the program assigns you a demerit point and if ones' speed crosses the set 12 demerit points, the program returns "Cancelled Licemce!"(codeTest2.js)

The third test entails calculating someone's net salary. The program will ask for your basic salary and benefits as inputs, run the keyed in values against some calculations and conditions and in the end provide an output which will be your net salary.(codeTest3.js)

When writing down the code for the three tests i encountered errors, example in test one that is index.js, the initial code would run after i copy pasted it on to the console but wouldn't run in vs code. I had to alter my code so that it would be able to run in the vs code. Parts of the comments in index.js are code that ran in the console but not in the vs code. i choose to retain them for future reference thus me commenting them instead of deleting them.
